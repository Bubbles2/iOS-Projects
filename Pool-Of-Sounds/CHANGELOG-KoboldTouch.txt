Version 6.1.12		24-Mar-2013
	[NEW] Feature-Demo template project - used to test and demonstrate new KT features. Demos included in first version:
		Tilemap with stop-at-border scrolling, draws objects
		Tilemap with parallaxing, horizontal endless scrolling, iPad scale factor 2x, iPad hi-res tilesets
		Multi-Touch Events, track individual fingers (touch finger 1, 2, 3, lift fingers 1&2, item 3 still dragged by finger 3)
		Motion Events: raw, smoothed, instantaneous with moving label for each to demonstrate differences
		Push/Pop scenes: push, pop, pop to root, and pop to new scene. Pop scenes with transitions!
		ScrollLayer: demo for KTScrollLayerViewController
	[NEW] push, pop, pop all, pop all & replace support for scene view controllers
	[NEW] KTModel: added setObject:ForKey: and objectForKey: to store generic objects in model
	[NEW] KTTilemapLayer: endlessScrollingHorizontal & endlessScrollingVertical properties to allow endless scrolling in only one direction
	[NEW] KTScrollLayerViewController: controller for CCScrollLayer (cocos2d-iphone-extensions)
	[NEW] KTRenderTextureViewController: controller for CCRenderTexture
	[NEW] KTMultiTouchController: keeps track of a specific finger's touch by keeping it in the same position of touchEvents array
	[FIX] KTMultiTouchController: fix always swallowing touches issue (touches not propagating to other controllers)
	[FIX] Tilemaps: possibly wrong tilesets loaded on Retina iPhone and iPads, depending on tileset extensions & file format
	[UPD] cocos2d-iphone v2.1 rc1
	[UPD] cocos2d-iphone-extensions (develop-v2, commit from Jan 15, 2013)

Version 6.1.11		18-Mar-2013
	[NEW] KTMouseController: receive mouse events with KTMouseEvent object (game-relevant & properly converted properties)
	[NEW] KTKeyboardController: receive key events with KTKeyEvent object (game-relevant & properly converted properties)
	[NEW] KTTilemapViewController: tileCoordFromPoint:relativeToMapSize: returns coords guaranteed to be within tilemap.mapSize boundary
	[NEW] KTTilemap: restoreTileset for removing a tileset alias created with replaceTileset:withTileset:
	[NEW] KTMultiTouchController: can now receive all touch events in one method -> touchesEvent: and touchEvent:
	[FIX] KTMultiTouchController: did not properly swallow touches when multiple controllers registered for touch events
	[FIX] Tilemap setTileGid: did not update all layers right away, other layers required a scroll operation to update
	[FIX] KTSceneViewController: optimized access to common scene controllers like motion, multitouch, mouse, physics controllers.
	[FIX] Renamed KTMotionProtocol & KTMultiTouchProtocol to KTMotionDelegate & KTMultiTouchDelegate

Version 6.1.10		13-Mar-2013
	[NEW] KTTilemap: added _iPadScaleFactor & _scaleTilesetSpacingAndMargin - with properly sized -ipad(hd) tilesets, iPad tilemaps
		can be scaled up versions similar in size to iPhone but using higher detailed tileset images. Eg scale x2 creates a tilemap
		that's only ~1-3 tile rows/colums larger on iPad. For universal apps where same/similar number of visible tiles is important.
	[NEW] Tile Layers: _drawTileCoordinates will draw tile coords over tile layer for better orientation
	[NEW] KTTilemapViewController: can be initialized with existing KTTilemap object
	[NEW] Added color property to KTTextMenuItem to set text color
	[NEW] KoboldTouch-Template: simple "start from scratch" template with 3 scenes, each with a menu to switch scenes

	[FIX] KTTilemapViewController: scrollToTileCoordinate scrolled to wrong coord
	[FIX] Tilemap renderer: some rotated tiles were drawn offset by one tile size

	[NEW] Tilemap: get view position from tile coordinate (KTTilemapViewController). Can get both tile's origin and tile's center position.
	[FIX] Memory Leak: loadViewBlock & createModelBlock were not freed, causing references copied by the block to be retained indefinetely.
	[FIX] Physics Controllers: assertion when adding/removing body that is already nil (due to weak references, fixes crash in example game).
	[FIX] Removing view controller sends viewWill/DidDisappear messages to removed controller

		All TMX features supported: Opacity, Properties, Tile flipping, Objects, etc.
	[NEW] Tilemap: TMX will upscale TMX content automatically on Retina devices.
